# Common Issues

## Problems often encountered by new users

I'm starting this list to begin collating the various caveats around
building releases. As soon as I feel like I have a firm grasp of all the
edge cases, I'll formalize this in a better format perhaps as a
"Preparing for Release" document.


## Dependency issues

Ensure all dependencies for your application are defined in either the
`:applications` or `:included_applications` block of your `mix.exs` file. This is how the build
process knows that those dependencies need to be bundled in to the
release. **This includes dependencies of your dependencies, if they were
not properly configured**. For instance, if you depend on `mongoex`, and
`mongoex` depends on `erlang-mongodb`, but `mongoex` doesn't have `erlang-mongodb`
in it's applications list, your app will fail in it's release form,
because `erlang-mongodb` won't be loaded.

If you are running into issues with your dependencies missing their
dependencies, it's likely that the author did not put the dependencies in
the `:application` block of *their* `mix.exs`. You may have to fork, or
issue a pull request in order to resolve this issue. Alternatively, if
you know what the dependency is, you can put it in your own `mix.exs`, and
the release process will ensure that it is loaded with everything else.


## Configuration not working as expected

Due to the way `config.exs` is converted to the `sys.config` file used by
Erlang releases, it is important to make sure all of your config values are
namespaced by application, i.e. `config :myapp, foo: bar` instead of `config foo: bar`,
and access your config via `Application.get_env(:myapp, :foo)`. If you do not
do this, you will likely run into issues at runtime complaining that you are attempting
to access configuration for an application that is not loaded.

## Packaging fails with errors related to `erl_tar`

If your project has files or modules names which exceed the file name length limit of `erl_tar`,
you will see an error like the following:

```
Building release with MIX_ENV=dev.

     {'EXIT',
         {function_clause,

If you run into problems, please create an issue, and I'll address ASAP.
